## Scan infrastructure as code templates

infrastructure ip is 35.170.164.98

### Example vulnerability

Description
This plugin is a SYN 'half-open' port scanner. It shall be reasonably quick even against a firewalled target.

Note that SYN scans are less intrusive than TCP (full connect) scans against broken services, but they might cause problems for less robust firewalls and also leave unclosed connections on the remote target, if the network is loaded.
